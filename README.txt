This is a repository for TEE probe sensorization. The code reported here is related to the IEEE TMRB paper "A Multi-sensorization Approach to Improve Safety in Transesophageal Echocardiography" (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10542419).

In the Sensor fusion folder, code for sensor data upsampling and import to ROS topics and finite state machine based EKF-IKF fusion is provided. The code was developed for ROS Noetic. Please update the upsample node by configuring the input topics based on the sensors you are currently using.

In the Sensor registration folder, code for the generalized Chardonnens' registration approach is provided. The main function is represented by Final Registration.m, while the other files contains support functions. Run this registration algorithm after having collected sensors data through upsample node and Matlab Simulink (so to have .mat files containing your sensor data). Please, consider movements with 360Â° rotations along three orthogonal axes as reported in the original work by Chardonnens' (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021929012003417).
